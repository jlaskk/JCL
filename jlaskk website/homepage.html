			I have goals that I have set for myself and I will stop at nothing to make sure I find a way to them. A few amongst this list includes: starting my own software company, create or redesign a high school in my community that focuses on pushing students into stem careers, but most importantly I want to positively impact the world with the experiences and knowledge that I have and will gain on this journey called life. So, if you believe you can help me reach my goals or if I reach out to you for an opportunity then know that I believe that you are perfectly aligned with my journey and it's goal. Thank you for your time
